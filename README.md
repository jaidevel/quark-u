# {quark-u}

**Smaller. Faster. Fundamental utilities for modern web development.**

`quark-u` is a tiny SCSS and JS utility framework designed for projects that need performance, control, and flexibility — without the overhead of larger CSS frameworks.

- Lightweight utility classes (prefixed for safety).
- Modular SCSS structure.
- Minimal vanilla JS components (modal, offcanvas, more coming).
- Easy to customize and extend.

## Getting Started

1. Install via NPM (coming soon).
2. Or clone the repo and build using your preferred bundler.

## Philosophy

**quark-u** focuses on providing only the building blocks you really need — nothing more.
